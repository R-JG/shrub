# Introduction

Shrubbery is a new in-development application model for Urbit. This guide will introduce the foundational Shrubbery concepts and get you started writing shrubs of your own. _It is aimed at Urbit developers who have at least been through App Academy, or are otherwise familiar with Gall agents._

At time of writing, Shrubbery's build system lives in a Gall agent called `%neo`. You can install this agent on a comet or moon with `|install ~met %neo`. You can install this desk on a fakeship from the GitHub repo, as detailed below.

## Cloning from GitHub

+ Clone the `urbit/shrub` repo to your machine.
+ Get the latest `urbit` [runtime](https://docs.urbit.org/manual/getting-started/self-hosted/cli).
+ Boot a fakeship with the `--loom 33` flag.
+ `|mount %base`
+ `rsync -avL —delete urbit/shrub/pkg/arvo/* pier/base`
+ `|commit %base`
+ `|start %neo`

This could take a while, you’ll see `booted %neo` in the Dojo when it’s complete.

## Directory structure

The only folders you need to understand for these tutorials are `/pro`, `/imp`, and `/con`.
- `/pro` for protocols. Like `/sur`, this is where your type definitions live.
- `/imp` for implementations. Like `/app`, this is where your app logic lives.
- `/con` for conversions. Like `/mar`, this is where you define rules for transforming nouns in your desk.

## Working in Sky

Sky is a UI for your local namespace. Three of the four examples in this guide are pre-loaded in there. The exception is Counter, which you'll build in your code editor and deploy in Sky yourself.

Every tile there represents a shrub located immediately beneath `/[%p our]/home` in the namespace. In the Counter tutorial you'll learn how to make your own shrubs at this location.

## Troubleshooting

If in doubt, `|nuke %neo` and `|start %neo`.

You'll definitely have to do this if...
- You make a change to a `/pro` file.
- You make a change to the `+init` behavior of a shrub that's in %neo's boot sequence (e.g. `/imp/home`).

If you keep restarting %neo, you'll eventually run out of loom. At this point you should delete your ship and boot up another one.

## Upcoming Changes

Everything in these guides is accurate at time of writing, but Shrubbery is a work in progress. Many implementation details are subject to change.

The way Shrubbery handles user interfaces is the most undercooked part of the system that we spend significant time on in these guides. Accessing `bowl:neo` within the `/con` files is how we get data into the UI, this is likely to change.

This guide launched at the June 2024 Lake Summit, and has an expiration date of sometime in Q3.
